# Welcome to Sagrada

*MULTIPLAYER RULES*

========================================================

**INITIAL SETUP**

At the beginning of the game, 4 Window Pattern Cards will be shown to each player.
Each player selects 1 of the 4 Window Patterns Cards to play ,the other card aren’t used.

NOTE: Windows have varying difficulty from level 3 (easiest) to 6 (hardest) as indicated near the name. Difficult windows give more Favor Tokens.

**GAMEPLAY**

Each game of Sagrada is played over 10 rounds.
At the beginning of each round, a draftpool of dice will be generated and each dice will be rolled.
The number of dice pulled depends on the number of players:

        2 Players - 5 Dice
        3 Players - 7 Dice
        4 Players - 9 Dice

Beginning with the Start Player, each player takes a turn in clockwise order.
On a player’s turn, they may perform each of the following actions in any order:

        • Select 1 die from the Draft Pool and place it in an open space on their Window
        • Use 1 Tool Card by spending Favor Tokens

Each action is optional — A player may choose to perform both actions, only one action or pass their turn taking no actions.
Turns proceed clockwise with each player taking a turn or passing.
Once the Start Player has taken their second turn, proceed to the end Of the Round.


NOTE: Each player can place ONLY 1 DICE for each turn. Total DICE for ROUND: 2!!!

TIP: Being the first to use each Tool Card costs the fewest Favor Tokens.
However, Tool Card abilities become more useful later in the game as player’sWindows fill with dice.

**PLACING DICE**

When placing a die on a Window:

        • First die: Each player’s first die of the game must be placed on an edge or corner space
        • Every other die must be adjacent to a previously placed die, touching diagonally (different row and column) or orthogonally (same row or column)
        • The die must match the color or value restriction of the space. White spaces have no restrictions
          *[ Example - A red space on the window may only be filled by a red die (any value).
           A space showing a 3 may only be filled by a die showing a 3 (any color) ]*
        • Dice may never be placed orthogonally adjacent to a die of the same color or the same value.
          *[ Example - Two red dice or two dice showing a 3 may not be placed side by side
           Players may choose not to draft a die during their turn ]*


NOTE: Any die may be placed on a white space as long as all the above restrictions are obeyed

TIP : Try to avoid placing dice next to a matching space (such as a 2 die next to a 2 space or red die next to a red space)
so a future die can still be placed in that space

**TOOLCARDS AND FAVOR TOKEN**

Players may spend Favor Tokens to gain a special ability from 1 Tool Card during their turn:

        1. Place Favor Tokens on the Tool Card — 1 if there aren’t any tokens on the card, otherwise place 2.
        2. Use the ability listed on the Tool Card

Players may choose not to use a Tool Card on their turn.
All remaining dice are placed on the Round Track.
After 10 rounds, players score points based on public and private objectives —the highest scoring artisan is the winner!


Nota: se una toolcard chiede di selezionare un dado, vuol dire che dovrai anche piazzarlo in quel turno!
TIP: fai attenzione alle tue scelte
