# Welcome to Sagrada

*Overview*

You are an artist competing with fellow artists to create the most beautiful stained glass window in the Sagrada Familia.
Your glass pieces are represented by dice, which have a color and a value.

Each round, players will take turns drafting from a pool of dice, placing these dice on their window.
Players must place them within the color and shade restrictions on their Window card,and never have adjacent dice of the same color or value.
After 10 rounds, players score points based on public and private objectives â€”the highest scoring artisan is the winner!

NOTE: Each player can place ONLY 1 DICE for each turn. Total DICE for ROUND: 2!!!
